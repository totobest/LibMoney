Version: 0.9.0
  Features:
    - You cannot build neither belts outside as they are not waterproof (duh).
    You can only build them in Factorissimo2 buildings.
    - A Factorissimo2 level 0 is now available when starting a game.
    - Cities spawn in the map randomly. Providing what they need gives you cash in return.
    - [TechnologyMarket] Spend your cash to research new technologies. Labs now accepts ucoin.
    - [BlackMarket2] You can sell/buy items/fluids/energy through the Black Market
    - As there is no more belts outside, mining-drills are not easy to automate at low-tech. You might have to
     use AAI miners instead.
    - Get better at Multimodal transport or combined transport:
      - Use AAI Hauler to transport items between buildings.
      - Use Train to transport items between buildings.
      - Use Air to transport items between buildings. (v1.0.0)
    - Fluid -> You need to use barrels (maybe later, hauler for fluids?)
    - Of course, native are not going to help you in the task.
    - Cities might change their needs randomly. The growth of
    the output of primary industries depends upon the percentage of cargo
    transported away from them. The more you transport, the faster it grows in
    the long term on average.


  Changes:
    None


----------
Backlog:

- [BlackMarket2] Loans can be taken out by a player. Loan interest is paid monthly to the bank,
at the current interest rate. The initial interest rate is set at the game start
according to the difficulty settings. The interest rate does not change during the game.

- Be-aware of bankruptcy,  are not nice with people who does not pay.

Property Maintenance
Why did I build so many signals?
The expense of property maintenance is directly proportional to the company's
number of rail and road pieces, canals, and station/airport tiles. You can see
the cost for each type of infrastructure from the Company window.
